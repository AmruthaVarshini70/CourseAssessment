This project is a web-based Student Marks Management Portal developed using Java Server Pages (JSP). It is designed to help educational institutions manage student academic performance through a simple and intuitive interface. The portal allows users—such as students and faculty—to register, log in, upload academic scores, and view overall results efficiently. It focuses on simplifying the evaluation process by digitizing the entry and display of marks such as mid-examinations and external assessments.

The portal consists of multiple JSP files, each serving a distinct purpose. The register.jsp file provides a registration form that lets new users create their accounts. After registration, users can log in using the login.jsp page, which validates credentials and grants access to the main system. Upon successful login, users are directed to the welcome.jsp page that acts as the dashboard interface.

Faculty members can enter marks using the upload.jsp page, where they input mid and external scores. Separate pages like mid1.jsp and mid2.jsp are used to handle the entry or display of marks for Mid-1 and Mid-2 examinations respectively. The externals.jsp page allows faculty or admin users to upload or review external marks scored by students. Finally, the overall.jsp page computes and displays the complete performance summary by aggregating the internal and external marks.

To run the project, place all files into the web application folder of a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. Configure the backend to connect to a MySQL (or other) database that contains tables for student information and marks. Once the server is running, users can access the portal through a local URL, such as http://localhost:8080/your-app-name/.

This application uses JSP and HTML for the front end and integrates Java for backend logic. The project is a lightweight academic solution with potential for extension to include features like grading systems, email notifications, or real-time performance analytics. For improved security and functionality, developers are encouraged to add user session management, form validations, and proper input sanitization.

Overall, this JSP-based system offers a practical solution for educational institutions seeking a simple marks entry and performance review system. It reduces manual work and ensures accurate tracking of student performance across exams.
